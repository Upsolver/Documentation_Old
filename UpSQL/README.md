# Upsolver SQL

## What is Upsolver SQL (UpSQL)

Upsolver SQL (UpSQL) provides an easy to use and powerful SQL interface for data ingestion, integration and transformation when creating Upsolver Outputs, without the need to write code in a programming language such as Java or Python.

Upsolver frictionless ingestion data lake ETL runs the Upsolver Engine that executes UpSQL queries.

This includes processing, reading data from various data sources (Such as: Amazon S3, Amazon Kinesis Streams and Kafka) and writing data to the desired target (Such as: Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, ElasticSearch and RDS).

UpSQL is based on ANSI SQL so it is easy and intuitive to use for users with previous SQL knowledge.
