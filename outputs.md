# Outputs

In addition to [Materialized Views](/Materialized-views.md) Upsolver supports exporting your data after your transformations and enrichments to many different destinations.

## Output Types

There are two main output types Upsolver supports. 

The first are the [batch outputs](/outputs/batch-outputs.md) such as [Amazon S3 Output](/outputs/s3.md) and [Redshift Output](/outputs/redshift-output.md).

The second output types are the [Online Outputs](/outputs/online-outputs.md) such as the [Slack Output](/outputs/online-outputs/slack-output.md) and the [HTTP Output](/outputs/online-outputs/http-output.md).
